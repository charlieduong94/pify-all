# pify-all

`bluebird`'s `promisifyAll` implemented with
[pify](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pify).
For those times when you don't want to pull in all
of `bluebird` just to promisify some functions
and you want it to work in the browser.

This is essentially a fork of
[util-promisifyall](https://github.com/charlieduong94/util-promisifyall).

## Installation

```bash
npm i pify-all
```
